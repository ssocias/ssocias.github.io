        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
        <hr>
        <h4><span class="bold">Posted by: </span> ssocias on July 13, 2015</h4>
        <hr><br>
        <p>Christina had a great idea: let’s create an app where we can make forecasts on future events and share with our friends. We’re constantly making predictions for the future anyways so how great would it be to have a place to keep all those predictions and actually figure out how accurate we are!? With this app, we can predict everything from “What will I have for dinner tonight?” and “Will our friend Johnny drop out of college?” to “Who will become the next president?” and “How many games will the Bucs win this season?”</p>

        <p>Yes, this is awesome. But, where do we start? We’ve never created an app before. While I “studied” computer science in college, it was mostly theoretical. I didn’t even write my first program until Junior year (having transferred to the major late). The learning curve would be huge. Christina and her friend Jimmy started designing the app using Illustrator and Powerpoint. They put together the basic layouts of the app and played around with prototype software like InVision. I reached out to some of my old professor for advice and also started talking to various software companies. We quickly found that we had nowhere near enough money to just hire a firm to make our MVP. And I couldn’t do it myself- it would take me waaaay too long. What now?</p>

        <p><a href="stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> to the rescue! In the time since Christina came up with the idea in May and now (November), I had started working for a lab at Harvard Medical School. My work was focused on web apps using Django. I had barely even heard of Django and had never done any web programming at all, but I was slowly getting better, one tutorial at a time. Stack Overflow quickly became my go-to site. After struggling for days on one problem in particular, I made my own post on SO. Who would answer my question.....Brandon! Maybe he regrets that fateful day when he replied to my post but Cassie is forever grateful. </p>

        <p>After Brandon solved my problem (and voluntarily helped me work through the issue via screenshare), I mentioned that I was trying to build an app. By this time, we had decided to build a web app (instead of a native iOS app) since it would be “cheaper” and universally available to all users, regardless of phone type. This would be our MVP and the first step to eventually creating native iOS and Android apps.</p>

        <p>So, Brandon agreed and we were off! Throughout this development, I learned much more about web dev and worked alongside Brandon to build Cassie v1. There are still many changes in the works and I’m working on them as fast as possible. Cassie is a deceivingly difficult app, with lots of different pieces, so hang with us as we continue to improve!</p>

        <h3>Hello from Christina</h3>

        <p>Allow me to introduce myself. I am Christina Socias, the other half of Cassie. Stephanie is my sister first and co-founder second. I never planned to have a startup with my sister, we just fell into this together and haven’t looked back since. Anyone who has spoken to me in the past year would think someone named “Cassie” is my sister. Nope! Cassie has been the focal point of our lives now since May 2014. As such, we decided to start this blog to document Cassie’s growth.</p>

        <p>This blog is meant to be a complete reveal of the development of our startup. We don’t want to hold anything back because I think anyone who has any interest in starting their own company could benefit from uncensored access into another’s struggle at developing their startup. I use the word struggle because I am not afraid to admit that Cassie’s journey has not been easy. It has been the most exciting and satisfying venture but not easy! As we write this blog, please feel free to give us pointers, tell us what you think we’re doing wrong, and help us make Cassie a true success. Our intent is that in the very near future you, your friends, family, and strangers on the street are forecasting on Cassie right from their phone.</p>

        <p>Thanks for reading</p>

        <p>To a bright future,</p>

        <p>Howdy Everyone (and by everyone, I mean the millions of people reading this blog of course)!</p>

        <p>Stephanie here. I'm one of the co-founders of Cassie Innovations. My sister Christina and her friend Jimmy are the other two co-founders but since Jimmy is now in med school, it's just Christina and I at the helm. We've been working on Cassie since May 2014 and have come a long way over the past year...but there is much more to come! Our beta version is live at <a href="https://cassieapp.com" target="_blank">cassieapp.com</a> and we have this cool website/blog to tell you about everything we're doing to get Cassie off the ground.</p>

        <p>In posts to come, Christina and I will share our story of building this startup. In the meantime, make sure to create an account on Cassie and start forecasting. I've been at the top of our leaderboard for some time so feel free to try and take my spot!</p>

        <p>Oh, and if you have any comments or suggestions on how we can make Cassie better, leave a message below or shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:teamcassie@cassieapp.com">teamcassie@cassieapp.com</a>.</p>
